# Smart Dustbin using Arduino

Smart Dustbin as its name represents it works smartly or we can say that it is an automatic dustbin. it works like when you will come in front of this dustbin it will open automatically with the help of a servo motor, so there is some sensor work to detect the object in front of the dustbin.

smart Dustbin is a very good project from the Arduino board. it works likewise smart things, i can say that, It is a decent gadget to make your home clean and attractive. due to practically all offspring of home consistently make it grimy and spread trash to a great extent by paper, rappers and numerous different things.

# Hardware Required

* Arduino Uno
* Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04
* SG-90 micro servo motor
* Dustbin

# Software Required

* Arduino IDE

# Working Concept


The program for the Arduino code can be downloaded here. Upload the code to Arduino Uno. Stick the Arduino, and battery on the wall of the dustbin using a double-sided tape.

* The smart dustbin uses an Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 to detect objects in front. 
* It then sends the signals to Arduino Uno. The Arduino understands the signal and sends a signal to the Servomotor which opens the flap on top of the dustbin.
* Here I have program it to open the race for only 3 seconds after 3 seconds the flap automatically closes. You can change that time just by making minor changes to the code in Arduino IDE.
* The circuit diagram for smart dustbin contains three main components: Arduino Uno, Power supply and an ultrasonic sensor.
* The Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 pins echo and trig are connected to Arduino Uno pins 5 and 6 respectively. The VCC pin is connected to 5V on Arduino Uno and both the grounds are connected together.
* Servo motor signal pin to 7 and gnd to gnd and positive to 3.3 V.
* A 9v battery has been connected to Vin pin on the Arduino Uno and grounds are connected together.
